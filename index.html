      <h2>PLATYPUSES USED TO BE GIANT</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient versions of a lot of modern animals, including penguins, were oversized monsters compared to the animals we know today, and platypuses are no different. In 2013, the discovery of a single tooth helped researchers identify a prehistoric platypus that was more than three feet long double the size of the modern animal.

      <h2>SCIENTISTS THOUGHT THE FIRST KNOWN PLATYPUS WAS A HOAX</h2>
      <p>
        When the first platypus specimen was sent back to England from Australia in the late 18th century, the scientists who examined it thought that someone was playing a trick on them. It naturally excites the idea of some deceptive preparation by artificial means, zoologist George Shaw wrote in the first scientific description of the platypus, published in 1799. One of the most remarkable and weird aspects of the platypus, its ability to lay eggs was not discovered for another 100 years.

      <h2>PLATYPUS BILLS GIVE THEM A SIXTH SENSE</h2>
      <p>
        A platypus bill has thousands of cells that give it a sort of sixth sense, allowing them to detect the electric fields generated by all living things. It is so sensitive that the platypus can hunt with its eyes, ears, and nose all closed, relying entirely on the bill electrolocation.
